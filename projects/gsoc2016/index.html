  <p class="pl-1">
    Reactive and adaptive planning is necessary in situations with unknown environment, few sensors and many occlusions.
    Reactiveness is the mechanism to avoid collision and adaptiveness is one to complete the task.
    The inputs to achieve these mechanisms are sensor inputs and user operations.
    Based on these prerequisites, I created a system for reactive and adaptive planning as shown in below:
  </p>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-10 offset-xs-1 col-md-6 offset-md-3">
      <img class="img-fluid" src="https://github.com/wkentaro-archive/gsoc2016/raw/master/img/system_figure.png" />
    </div>
  </div>
  <p class="pl-1">
    The part of the system consists of a simulator, but the component, Simulator, can be replaced by the real robot.
    The inputs are provided the simulated sensor and a user in the system.
    Using these inputs, the two mechanism are achieved with <b>Stop execution</b> and <b>Re-planning</b>:
    the former is a function for reactiveness and the latter is one for adaptiveness.
    As a reactiveness, the system needs to stop the joint trajectory execution of the robot to avoid collision in an environment,
    and as a adaptiveness the system needs to re-plan the joint trajectory to complete the task based on the information at stopping execution.
  </p>
  <p class="pl-1">
    In this project I worked for the two functions, stop execution and re-planning, and also the required components in the above system.
    The sections afterward describes about the complete/incomplete things of this project, and the prefix in the title (eg. [Reactive], [Simulator])
    represents what are the changes for.

        <p>
          This function is required to stop trajectory execution by operator inputs, and for the reactiveness in the system.
          I created a GUI to achieve this function and sent PR to <a href="https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_ros">one of the repos of MoveIt!</a>.
          In the end, this PR is closed (not merged) and one of the maintainers provided <a href="https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_ros/pull/713">another PR</a>

        <p>
          This is a PR to simulate the robot fanuc_lrmate200id on one of the most popular simulators on robotics, Gazebo, based on closed PRs/Issues
          (<a href="https://github.com/ros-industrial/fanuc_experimental/pull/19">ros-industrial/fanuc_experimental#19</a>,

          <a href="https://github.com/ros-industrial/fanuc/issues/145">ros-industrial/fanuc#145</a>), for creating the whole system.
          The reason why the robot is chosen is that the real robot is owned by the one of the maintainers, and he can use my code with it.
          Gazebo is a physics simulator, so in order to spawn the model and use it, it is necessary to set the inertial values.
          The correct inertial values are not open (as shown in <a href="https://github.com/ros-industrial/fanuc_experimental/issues/22">ros-industrial/fanuc_experimental#22</a>),
          so I estimated it with the meshes of the links and Meshlab in a way described <a href="http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=inertia&cat=#Computingtheinertialparameters">here</a>.

        <p>
          This is an bug report I proposed, but not yet fixed.
          The OctomapServerContact is a voxel collision object map generation method using robot contact aside from the point cloud sensed with RGB-D cameras,
          and this kind of mapping is necessary for re-planning after the detecting contact and stopping execution.
          So this is a feature for adaptiveness in the system.
          Currently the voxel map is not updated with the robot contact that is detected with force sensors, and it needs to be fixed.

          Monitoring trajectory execution is necessary for operator cancel GUI handling as described <a href="#stop_execution">here</a>.
          Also the function to monitor the execution is necessary for controllers for completely automated system, because
          the robot controller needs to select canceling execution or waiting for the completion during the execution.

          This demo is to show the function of reactiveness of the system. In the demo, a force sensor at the last joint of the robot detects the unexpected force input,
          and the controller stops the trajectory execution based on that.
          Without the reactiveness the robot breaks with collision to the floor, but with my system the robot successfully detects the floor.
          The result is shown in below movies, one is without reactiveness and the other is with it:

          This demo is to show the function of reactiveness and adaptiveness of the system in a situation with few sensors, and many occlusions, with a operator input.
          The task is to pick object from a red bin and place it in a shelf bin. The shelf bin has many occlusions and robot needs to detect collision and stop trajectory execution if necessary.
          The operator can stop the trajectory execution with unexpected force input, and successfully complete the task based on the history of the contact beforehand.
          The result is shown in below movies, one is to show the reactiveness and the other is to show the completion of task afterwards:

  <p class="pl-1">
    For reactive and adaptive planning, functions for stopping trajectory execution and re-planning are necessary.
    I completed most of the features for reactiveness but there are still some open issues for re-planning:
    <a href="#issue_moveit_scene">#issue_moveit_scene</a>, <a href="#issue_octomap_contact">#issue_octomap_contact</a>.
    The demonstrations above shows the system is effective in a situation with few sensors and occlusions, but the completely automated planning
    using only sensor inputs not operator inputs is not yet tackled. It is one of the future works.
